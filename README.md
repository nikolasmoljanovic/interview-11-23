# interview-11-23

This project includes back-end REST services for New Library Fronted (NLF) interview requirement.
Functionality covers just the basic required scenarios, also some integration and unit test have been implemented.
This is a JAVA Spring Boot aplication running with PostgresSQL, while Liquibase has been used as a DB tool for initializing and versioning of DB.
Project structure and best practices were the main purpose of this, so this will cover only basic stuff (no security etc.).

**Before start:**

- create an empty Postgres DB named: demo_db_nikola running on default port 5432.

**Start**

- run the application, it should start on port 8080
